# TODO list

## For the website : 
 - change font (maybe something like scratch font)
 - improve glossary linking

## Missing adaptation from the book : 
 - add Low-hanging fruit (stupid strings) section
 - adapt the Computational Complexity section
 - adapt the Ray-based 3D rendering/Basics section
 - adapt the ray-based-3D-rendering/ray-tracing section, though I don't know if this is approved, it seems a bit messy
 - adapt the whole ray-based-3D-rendering/path-tracing section
 - add scratchblocks in rasterization-and-triangles/rendering-basics/converting-to world-space
 - add scratchblocks in ray-based-3D-rendering/ray-marching/useful-primitives
 - add scratchblocks in grids/projection/what-is-a-coordinate
 - add scratchblocks in movement/movement
 - add MathJax equations in movement/movement
 - add missing illustrations in movement/movement/SAT Collision Detection Algorithm
 - add missing math functions in math-functions/math-functions

TheReal_BestGamer also wrote some sections which do not comply to the writing style of the book, so they first need to be entirely re-written before being added to the website : 
 - Rasterization and Triangles/rendering basics/converting to view-space
 - Rasterization and Triangles/rendering basics/Z clipping
 - ray-based-3D-rendering/2.5d-ray-casting/floorcasting
 - ray-based-3D-rendering/2.5d-ray-casting/terrain
 - ray-based-3D-rendering/2.5d-ray-casting/sprites
