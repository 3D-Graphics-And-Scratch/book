# Glossary

#### AABB : {.aabb}
Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) - A bounding box aligned with the axes of the coordinate system.

#### Buffer : {.buffer}
A section of memory used for temporary data storage.

#### BVH : {.bvh}
Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) - A tree-based acceleration structure containing primitive 3D objects that speeds up ray-casting and various algorithms.

#### Camera Space : {.camera-space}
*(Also known as; View Space, Eye Space)* - 3D coordinates projected relative to the camera, including relative depth.

#### Cross Product : {.cross-product}
An operation between two vectors that returns a vector perpendicular to the input vectors. The magnitude of this vector is the product of the magnitudes of the input vectors and the sine of the angle between them.

#### Lerp : {.lerp}
Linear Interpolation.

#### Depth Buffer : {.depth-buffer}
An additional screen-space buffer that provides depth information.

#### DOF : {.dof}
Depth of Field (DOF) - The distance between the nearest and the furthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus in an image captured with a camera.

#### Dot Product : {.dot-product}
An operation between two vectors that returns the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them.

#### Epsilon : {.epsilon}
A very small value, mostly used to prevent floating-point inaccuracies and to set ray marching limits.

#### Focal Length : {.focal-length}
A camera property that indicates how strongly it converges or diverges light. It is inversely proportional to the Field of View (FOV).

#### FOV : {.fov}
Field of View (FOV) - The angular extent of the world that is seen. It is inversely proportional to the focal length.

#### Length : {.length}
The magnitude of a vector.

#### Magnitude : {.magnitude}
The length of a vector.

#### Mesh : {.mesh}
A collection of faces, edges, and vertices that define an object's shape.

#### Model Space : {.model-space}
*(Also known as; Object Space, Local Space)* - 3D coordinates relative to another point of reference, typically used to store meshes of individual models or objects.

#### Surface Normal : {.surface-normal}
A vector perpendicular to the surface of an object.

#### Pen : {.pen}
A vanilla Scratch extension used to draw on the screen.

#### Procedural : {.procedural}
Defined by code.

#### Rasterizer : {.rasterizer}
An algorithm that draws objects to the screen by filling in shapes pixel-by-pixel.

#### Ray : {.ray}
Defined by its origin (a position in 3D space where the ray starts) and its direction.

#### Screen Space : {.screen-space}
*(Also known as; Clip Space)* - 2D information of 3D coordinates projected to the screen, without depth information.

#### SDF : {.sdf}
Signed Distance Field (SDF) - A function defining distance to the surface of an object, with interior points being negative and exterior points being positive.

#### Vector : {.vector}
An object having direction as well as magnitude, used to determine the position of one point in space relative to another.

#### Vertex : {.vertex}
A point with a coordinate vector.

#### Viewing Frustum : {.viewing-frustum}
The region of space in the modeled world that may appear on the screen.

#### World Space : {.world-space}
3D coordinates relative to the center of the world, typically (0, 0, 0).
