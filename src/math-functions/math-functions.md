Scratch doesn’t include a lot of useful mathematical or vector manipulation functions like in other programming languages. Here is a useful list of common math functions written in Scratch code : 

**Dot product:** tells how alike 2 vectors are, if they are the same length. 1 means they are the same vector and \-1 means they are the exact opposites, and 0 means they are perpendicular to each other.

**Exponents:** repeatedly multiplies x by itself y times.

**Cross product:** gives a vector perpendicular to the 2 vectors inputted.

**Test if triangle is ordered clockwise :** (useful for backface culling)

**Normalize:** sets a vector’s magnitude to 1, while retaining its direction.

**Transpose**: Rotating the matrix format (For inverse TBN since inverse is expensive and they do the same thing in that case.)
